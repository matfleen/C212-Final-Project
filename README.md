# C212-Final-Project
## Overview
This is the final project for CSCI-C212 for spring 2018 at Indiana University. This is by far the biggest undertaking of my programming career, not in terms of technical difficulty, but in terms of sheer scope. 
Our project is a simulation of a library system, where users can log on as a student or librarian and can view books, check them out, and other functions that one would expect to see at a library.
The system is sometimes buggy, however it is functional to the point that most users should not have a problem using it.
